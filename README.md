# 42-WildCard-PythonML
The following is pratice code for my endevors into Python and Machine learning.

### What is Wildcard?

Wildcard is a project that allows you you work on whatever you'd like and gain XP within the 42 program.
Wildcard idealy should only be 50 hours of work for everything. Including Github and Envioroment setup.

### What does this project do?
This is a Machine Learning project (with TensorFlow) To teach myself how to use Tensor Flow and other aspects of Python.
It takes in a 28X28 grayscale picture formated from CSV to figure out what digit it is.
It works between the values between 0 and 9. Very simple and has no way of splicing up any number more than 2 digits.
This project also a simple GUI that displays the selected image with the output and accuracy of the model.

## Installation
1. Install [Anaconda3](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) and make sure Conda is added to $PATH. (Anaconda will take a while to install.)
2. Run "Conda create -n (Name of envrioment) python=3.6" and say yes to install any new packages.
3. Activate the enviroment with "Conda activate (Enviroment)"
4. use "pip install (Package)" to install the following packages: (tensorflow, keras, pandas, numpy, Image)
5. run Python on main.py and watch!
